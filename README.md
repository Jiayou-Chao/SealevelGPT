# SealevelGPT

The project is still under development. The goal is to develop a GPT model that can answer questions related to sea level rise based on our model. To start a conversation, run the following command:

```bash
python chatgpt-sealevel.py
```

## Requirements

The environment requires both Python and R. `setup.sh` will install all the required packages for you. `setup.R` will install the required R packages. 

## OpenAI API Key

You will need to have an OpenAI API key to run the model. Once you have the key, you need to set it as an environment variable. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>
```

## External Data

The data used for the model to run is available upon reasoanble request.

More instructions will be added soon.
